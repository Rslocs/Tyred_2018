# Tyred
This was created as apart of a two day "Create Camp" hosted by Summer of Tech in conjunction with Spark, Pushpay, Xero, and a variety of other tech companies. This was the work from a team of 6, with 5 other members and one mentor. If you would like to see the original, with all of the commit history, please look at https://github.com/JerryTheAlien/Summer-of-tech.

This was a culmination of alot of blood and sweat, and while it has some serious security flaws, it was created under facilitated modern working conditions. The app is a token of the successful team created from this exercise, and while it is appreciated, the team that was created holds much more value to me.
